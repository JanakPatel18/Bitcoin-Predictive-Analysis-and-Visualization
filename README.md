# PROJECT WORK

## Selected Topic - Bitcoin Predictive Analysis and Visualization
Our group selected to work with the Bitcoin Historical Data (Jan 2012 to March 2021). Bitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency.

## Reason the topic was selected
1) The team members are cryptocurrency enthusiasts, mainly after completion of the last two modules.
2) We find the dataset interesting as it is merely numerical values.
3) We believe that there lies plenty of functionality within this dataset and are eager to dive into some of these values through machine learning methods.

## Description of the source of data
Data is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data.


## Questions we would like to answer with the data:

1)  How has Bitcoin's price in USD varied over time?

## Technologies Used: 

## a) Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## b) Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## c) Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the Machine Learning library we'll be using to create a classifier. 

## d) Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on Heroku.
