## Selected Topic - Bitcoin Predictive Analysis and Visualization
Our group selected to work with the Bitcoin Historical Data (Jan 2012 to March 2021). Bitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency.

## Reason the topic was selected
1) The team members are cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
2) We find the dataset interesting as it is merely numerical values.
3) We believe that there lies plenty of functionality within this dataset and are eager to dive into some of these values through machine learning methods.
4) We are interested in determining a short and long term market prediction using machine learning models
5) Since the dataset is primarily numerical values, and we have a historical dataset, we can possibly use both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to predidct Bitcoin prices

## Description of the source of data
Data is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data.

##  Description of the communication protocols 
Our team has created a group chat via Slack and is meeting on days that we do not have class.

## Team Member Roles

Janak -  Square

Anuradha - Tringle

Mark - Triangle

Uttam - Circle

Sherin - X

## Questions we would like to answer with the data:

1)  How has Bitcoin's price in USD varied over time?
2)  Can we predict Bitcoin's price in the future based prices from the previous days, months, or years?
3)  How has trading volume affected the price previously and how does it affect the price now?

## Technologies Used: 

## a) Exploratory Data Analysis
Various Libraray we will use like Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, date, seaborn, sklearn.model_selection nad all ML model libraries too will be used to perform EDA

## b) Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## c) Machine Learning
Will use different Machine Learning Model to do predictive analysis. SciKitLearn is the Machine Learning library we'll be using to create a classifier. 
1) Linear Regression
2) DecisionTreeRegressor
3) Lasso Regression

## d) Dashboard
No dashboard is required for the first segment.  In the future we will be using Tableau for the Dashboard.
